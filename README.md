## ðŸ”¤ Anagram Checker in C
A simple C program that checks whether two given words are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases that contain the same characters in a different order (e.g., listen and silent).

## ðŸ›  Dependencies
This program uses the following standard C libraries:

<stdio.h> â€” for input and output operations (printf, gets)

<string.h> â€” for string manipulation (strlen, strcpy, strcmp)

## ðŸš€ How It Works
Takes two words as input.

Copies the original strings to preserve them.

Sorts both strings alphabetically.

Compares the sorted strings using strcmp().

If they match, they are anagrams.

## âœ… Example Output
```c
Enter the First word: listen

Enter the Second word: silent
listen and silent are anagrams.
```
